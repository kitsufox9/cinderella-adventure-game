 * Hello! What is your name?
 * Nice to meet you, [name], and welcome to Cinderella's Magic Adventure!
 * You're on your way to the Prince's ball and you pass by a young girl sitting on a bench, crying.
 * Her name is Cinderella and she's crying because her stepmother and stepsisters won't let her go to the ball.
 * 
 * You want to help her, but what can you do? 
 * Stay and help, take her to the ball with you, or leave her alone?
 * prompt enter
 * 
 * >= Stay and cheer her up. What's a few minutes to help someone feeling down?
 *  > Cinderella tells you about her wicked stepmother and stepsisters. She says she just wishes she coudl
 * go to the ball and meet the prince to get away from her tragic family life. All of a sudden, a fairy godmother appears!
 * She asks who made a wish. Cinderella is too stunned to answer. Do you tell the truth, or lie and say it was you so you can get a free wish?
 *  >= Lie > The fairy godmother knows you're lying and sets your pants (or dress) on fire.
 *  >= Tell the truth. Cinderella made the wish. > The fairy godmother turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful gown, and turns the mice hiding in the bushes
 * into horses. But now all Cinderella needs is her own carriage because her dress can't fit in yours. The fairy godmother says she needs a pumpkin to turn into 
 * a carriage. She asks you to take only ONE pumpkin from the patch, or else. You go to the patch but find another plump pumpkin in the neighbor's yard underneath a mean looking scarecrow.
 * How many pumpkins will you take?
 *  >= 2 > The fairy godmother will never know you took an extra one for yourself. But wait, what's that ominous shadow lurking behind you? 
 * The scarecrow is suddenly alive and he's not happy! You find yourself stranded in a ditch, and you can't help Cinderella get to the ball so she's depressed and you're doomed and the scarecrow's prisoner. Too bad.
 *  >= 1 > This pumpkin's perfect! The fairy godmother turns it into a carriage and Cinderella is sent on her way. The fairy Godmother warns that Cinderella must leave before the clock strikes midnight. You follow along in your carriage to the ball.
 * You both arrive at the ball and enter. The prince immediately notices when you and Cinderella waltz in. He approaches you and Cinderella. Cinderella is stunned and can't speak. She's bad at communicating. 
 * Do you help out again and introduce Cinderella to the prince, or do you take advantage and introduce yourself (since you think the prince is kinda cute)?
 *  >= Introduce yourself. > The prince is not impressed because you seem desperate. He takes Cinderella out to the veranda, they dance the night away and fall in love. 
 *      Cinderella loses track of time with the prince. You notice that the clock is about to strike 12. Do you warn her or do you let her be since you're bitter about the prince choosing her anyway?
 *          >= Let her enjoy her night. > The clock struck 12 and Cinderella noticed too late. She began to run down the stairs and dropped her slipper. Do you pick it up or leave it?
 *              >= Pick it up > You return the shoe to Cinderella and she hurries home. But the prince never got her name! And he has no way to find her. Oh well, at least Cinderella had a fun night. Back to the cellar she goes.
 *              >= Leave it. > Help Cinderella get into her carriage. Luckily, the prince found the shoe and searched the kingdom for Cinderella and found her. They got married and you got invited to the wedding!
 *          >= Warn her. > Cinderella thanks you for warning her. She bids the prince goodnight but he begs her to stay. She tells him no, but he's pushy. Turns out Cinderella wasn't even having a good time anyway because the prince only talked about himself all night.
 *          
 *              >= Let her down easy. > You're flattered but Cinderella is not your type. She understands, but vows to never forget you. You go your separate ways.
 *              >= Accept her profession of love > You and Cinderella live happily ever after!
 *  >= Introduce Cinderella > The prince dances with Cinderella to be nice, but he actually likes you more. He dumps Cinderella and leaves with you. You lost a friend in Cinderella, but what does that matter when you're married to royalty?
 *      
 * 
 * >= Give her a ride to the ball. She's not properly dressed, but at least it's better than sitting around crying.
 * Only problem is, Cinderella doesn't have a nice dress. She only has her rags! Do you take her anyway? Or do you let her stay here to sulk?
 *  >= Let her stay. > Too bad. She doesn't want to embarrass herself in those clothes. You go to the ball feeling good because at least you tried to help.
 *  >= Take her anyway. > You tell Cinderella that everyone else in the kingdom doesn't dress well so she'll be okay in what she's wearing.
 *  Cinderella gets in your carriage and you go to the ball together. On the way, there's a sign pointing straight, warning that the road ahead is not safe to ride through.
 * You can ignore the warning and continue straight, take the path to the left which is a shortcut (through the bad side of town), or take the right path which seems safest?
 *  >= Right > Whoops! The sign was facing the wrong way! The dangerous path was actually the right path. Your driver loses control and the carriage crashes into a ditch. Looks like you and Cinderella
 * are stranded and can't go to the ball. Better luck next time!
 *  >= Straight > This path turned out to be fine. Whoever put that sign up must've been playing a prank. You and Cinderella arrive at the ball in a timely fashion.
 *  You and Cinderella proudly go into the ball in the front entrance. Everyone is shocked but impressed by Cinderella's bold look. She catches the prince's eye and he asks her to dance.
 * They quickly fall in love because the prince is impressed by Cinderella's unapologetic attitude and daring look. They get married and you're the guest of honor. Congrats to the lovely couple!
 *  >= Left > You arrive at the ball faster than the usual path even though your carriage got hit by a few tomatoes by the riff raff kids in the village. You arrive at the alternate entrance.
 *  But Cinderella is afraid because she spots her stepmother and stepsisters chatting by the door. She's afraid that they won't let her by. Do convince Cinderella to walk in anyway, or do you sneak Cinderella in around the back?
 *  >= Walk in boldly > Bad decision. You underestimated Cinderella's stepfamily's wickedness. As you and Cinderella walk in, they trip you both. And you and Cinderella fall headfirst into the big cake in the middle of the floor.
 *  Worst of all, the prince saw everything. He prefers graceful women. Embarrassed and defeated, you and Cinderella go back home.
 *  >= Sneak in the back > You successfully sneak in the back into the veranda. But oh no! You spot the prince standing alone. If he sees you sneaking in, he won't want to give Cinderella a chance. Do you hide behind the nearest tree, or introduce yourselves?
 *  >= Hide behind a tree. > You and Cinderella thought you were slick. The prince already saw you sneaking around and he dislikes dishonesty more than anything. He personally kicks you both out. But on the way out, your left shoe falls off.
 * Do you pick it up or leave it? 
 *      Pick it up > Big mistake! You run back to pick up your shoe, and bump into the prince. He falls back and stumbles into a statue. The statue, which is the king's favorite, falls over and breaks. The prince orders that you and Cinderella are arrested. 
 *      You and Cinderella go to jail and now she hates your guts.
 *      > Leave it > The prince picks up your shoe and likes your style. He searches the kingdom, finds you and marries you. Cinderella is jealous at first, but she gets over it.
 *  >= Introduce yourselves > He already saw you and Cinderella sneaking in, but the prince appreciates your honest approach and Cinderella's unapologetic look. You explain why you snuck in and he understands. The prince asks Cinderella to dance and they fall in love. 
 *      You're invited to the wedding. Congrats!
 * 
 * 
 * >= Leave her alone. It's none of your business anyway.
 *  > You go to the ball alone. You feel guilty because you're a jerk so you can't have any fun at the ball.
